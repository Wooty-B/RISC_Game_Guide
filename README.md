# RISC Game/Application Guide [WIP]

This will be WIP for a short time while working out the layout. Goal is to document running native (package/compile), translated (Box86/64), and emulated (Wine) games and productivity applications along with an experience rating. To keep this list curated and manageable, focus should be put on titles that at least initiate a graphical session; first objective is listing all games that are legitimately playable/completable. Not sure if I should detail this in a Google Spreadsheet but open to suggestion in the meantime!
