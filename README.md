# RISC Game/Application Guide [WIP]

This will be WIP for a short time while working out the layout. Goal is to document running native (binary/source), translated (Box86/64), and emulated (Wine) games and productivity applications along with an experience rating. To keep this list curated and manageable, focus should be put on titles that at least initiate a graphical session; first objective is listing all games that are legitimately playable/completable. Not sure if I should detail this in a Google Spreadsheet but open to suggestion in the meantime!

### Notes

1. MSI Package "dxvk" (DirectX-to-Vulkan) does not improve quality/framerate for some DirectX 9 games. (i.e.: Oblivion and Fallout 3) Therefore, not installing the package in your Wine directory (~/.wine/drive_c) will allow you to use games in Windowed mode, as Windowed mode is not available in the dxvk package and causes applications to crash.
